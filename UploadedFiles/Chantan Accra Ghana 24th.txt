Dear Sir,

I hope you are well. I am writing to you as a friend.

I have been an apprentice in a tailoring business for some time. I love my work, but my old sewing machine is causing me problems. I really need a new sewing machine to help me learn better and make good clothes.

I know this is a big request, but I hope you can help me. With your support, I can improve my skills and help my community.

If you would like to discuss this, I am happy to talk whenever you can.

Thank you for considering my request. I appreciate your time and help.

Best wishes,

Jonas Yawgen
