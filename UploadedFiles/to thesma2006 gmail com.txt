Request for Recommendation Letter
Hello Dr. Theresa,

I hope you are doing well.
This is Yiwere Muftawu Mohammed, your project student during the 2023/2024 academic year. I worked on the Behaviour Reinforcement System alongside Nathan Amankwa.
I am planning to apply for graduate studies abroad and would be very grateful if you could provide me with a recommendation letter.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Yiwere Muftawu Mohammed
